# Hospital_Management

**Introduction**
Efficient healthcare delivery hinges on how well hospitals manage their core operations such as
patient intake, doctor allocation, and appointment scheduling. Manual systems often lead to
data redundancy, errors, and time inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this project
presents a web-based Hospital Management System (HMS) designed using Jakarta EE for the
enterprise logic and Hibernate ORM for database operations. It uses MySQL for structured data
storage and JSP for rendering the frontend.
The system streamlines hospital processes by allowing staff to register patients, assign doctors,
and maintain records in a centralized, secure, and scalable manner. Its clean and user-friendly
interface provides a smooth experience for healthcare professionals, minimizing paperwork and
reducing human error.


**Objectives**
• To develop a structured web-based application to manage hospital operations.
• To implement CRUD functionality for patient and doctor records.
• To associate patients with doctors and allow appointment tracking.
• To use Hibernate ORM for efficient and reliable database interaction.
• To create a responsive user interface using JSP and CSS for improved user experience.


**Scope of the Project**
• Small and medium healthcare centers for managing basic patient and doctor data.
• Educational institutions for demonstrating enterprise application development.
• Expansion into a full-fledged hospital ERP with modules like billing, prescriptions, and
reports.
• A base framework for multi-user access and patient history tracking in future upgrades.


**System Architecture**
• Presentation Layer (JSP & CSS):
Interfaces for managing patients and doctors. Form-based input, status messages, and visual
cues for user interaction.
• Business Logic Layer (Jakarta EE Servlets):
Handles routing and task processing logic. Manages communication between UI and database
layers.
• Data Access Layer (Hibernate ORM):
Maps Java classes to database tables. Manages entity transactions with MySQL for
add/update/delete operations.
• Database Layer (MySQL):
Stores patient, doctor, and appointment records. Designed for scalability and data integrity
using relational schemas.


Modules of the Project
• Patient Registration - Allows new patients to be added with name, age, gender, and doctor
assigned.

• Appointment Allocation - Assign patients to doctors and track visit details (can be
extended)

**Technologies & Tools Used**
• Jakarta EE: For enterprise-grade servlet and web development
• Hibernate: For ORM and database transaction management
• MySQL: Backend relational database for data persistence
• JSP & JSTL: Front-end rendering and dynamic page generation
• CSS: Responsive and styled web UI
• Apache Tomcat: Server runtime for deploying the application
• NetBeans: IDE for Java EE development
• MySQL Workbench: Database design and management


**Expected Outcome**
• A fully working hospital management application with key features.
• Seamless CRUD operations and real-time updates of patient records.
• Improved understanding of MVC architecture and database integration.
• Functional demonstration of enterprise technologies in a real-world healthcare scenario.


**Conclusion**
This project showcases the effective application of Java enterprise technologies in solving realworld healthcare management problems. It demonstrates how various layers (frontend, backend,
and data access) can work together to build a scalable, extensible application.
By combining Jakarta EE and Hibernate, the HMS not only ensures ease of development but
also guarantees database safety, code reusability, and performance. As a future scope, modules
like user authentication, medication tracking, prescription generation, and appointment
reminders can be integrated to evolve this prototype into a complete Hospital ERP system.
